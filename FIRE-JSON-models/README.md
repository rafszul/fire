folder with visual representations of models from json schemas.

method:

the files from /v1-dev folder were uploaded to JSON Designer and exported as .png files to show visual representation of the models.

concept:

recreate using d3.js instead of JSON Designer so it retains interactivity.

further dev:

create an interface for potential contributors to the FIRE repo and hookup with github wiki section

d3.js
react.js
webpack
